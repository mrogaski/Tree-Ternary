README for Tree::Ternary

Tree::Ternary is a pure Perl implementation of ternary search trees as 
described by Jon Bentley and Robert Sedgewick.  Ternary search trees are
interesting data structures that provide a means of storing and accessing
strings.  They combine the time efficiency of digital tries with the space
efficiency of binary search trees.  Unlike a hash, they also maintain 
information about relative order.

For more information on ternary search trees, visit:

This module is a translation (albeit not a direct one) from the C
implementation published in Bentley and Sedgewick's article in the April
1998 issue of Dr. Dobb's Journal (see SEE ALSO).


PREREQUISITES

Tree::Ternary doesn't use any nonstandard modules.


INSTALLATION

You install Tree::Ternary, as you would install any perl module
library, by running these commands:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test     # Only if Test.pm is installed
   make install

If you want to install a private copy of Tree::Ternary in your home
directory, then you should try to produce the initial Makefile with
something like this command:

  perl Makefile.PL LIB=~/perl


DOCUMENTATION

POD-format documentation is included in Ternary.pm.  POD is readable
with the 'perldoc' utility.


SUPPORT
