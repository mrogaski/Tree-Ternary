			    Tree::Ternary

Tree::Ternary is a Perl implementation of ternary search trees as
described by Jon Bentley and Robert Sedgewick.  For more information

Tree::Ternary is a Perl implementation of ternary search trees as described
by Jon Bentley and Robert Sedgewick.  Ternary search trees are interesting
data structures that provide a means of storing and accessing strings.  They
combine the time efficiency of digital tries with the space efficiency of
binary search trees.  Unlike a hash, they also maintain information about
relative order.

This module is a translation (albeit not a direct one) from the C
implementation published in Bentley and Sedgewick's article in the April
1998 issue of Dr. Dobb's Journal (see SEE ALSO).


PREREQUISITES

This suite requires Perl 5; I've only used it under Perl 5.005, so for
anything lower, you're on your own.  I highly recommend the use of 
Test.pm, although, it is not required.

Tree::Ternary doesn't use any nonstandard modules.


INSTALLATION

You install Tree::Ternary, as you would install any perl module
library, by running these commands:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test     # Only if Test.pm is installed
   make install

If you want to install a private copy of Tree::Ternary in your home
directory, then you should try to produce the initial Makefile with
something like this command:

  perl Makefile.PL LIB=~/perl


DOCUMENTATION

POD-format documentation is included in Ternary.pm.  POD is readable
with the 'perldoc' utility.
